# Fifa.20
In this project we have done complete data analysis and cluster players according to their skills and performed some given tasks. For model implementation of this dataset, we have used K-means, XGboosting and Logistic Regressioin algorithms. Since we have stated that K means clustering is the best model for Fifa20.
